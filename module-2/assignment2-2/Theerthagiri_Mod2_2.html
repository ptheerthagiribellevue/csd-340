    <h2>Chapter 1: HTML</h2>
        <p class="intro">Hey there! I'm Praveen Theerthagiri, and I hail from the vibrant city of Bengaluru in Karnataka, India. Growing up, I had the loving presence of my mother and father by my side. My dad, a dedicated science professor at a local university, and my mom, a wonderful stay-at-home mom, instilled in me values that shaped who I am today. My younger brother, who is six years my junior, and I share an incredible bond that has only grown stronger over time.</p>
        <p>After completing high school, I embarked on a journey to pursue my associate's and bachelor's degrees in field of Computer Science. It laid the foundation for my academic growth and opened doors to new possibilities.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I love to unwind by either catching up on my favorite shows on Netflix or going out with friends to explore new places and experiences. Maintaining a healthy work-life balance is also crucial to me, as it keeps me motivated. </p>
        <p>Presently, I serve as a senior software developer at a banking sector. However, driven by a thirst for knowledge and personal growth, I've returned to school to pursue my master's degree at Bellevue University.</p>
